# Iris Data Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing the Iris dataset using the pandas library and visualizing the results with matplotlib and seaborn. The project fulfills the requirements of a data analysis assignment, which includes loading and exploring a dataset, performing basic statistical analysis, and creating visualizations.

# Project Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

## Data Loading and Exploration:
Loads the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris().
Displays the first few rows and checks for data types and missing values.
Notes that the dataset is clean, requiring no further preprocessing.


## Basic Data Analysis:
Computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
Groups data by species and calculates mean values for each feature.
Identifies patterns, such as size differences across species.


## Data Visualization:
Creates four visualizations:
Line chart of mean measurements by species.
Bar chart of average sepal length by species.
Histogram of petal length distribution.
Scatter plot of sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species.


Saves visualizations as iris_visualizations.png.
Includes titles, axis labels, legends, and uses seaborn for enhanced styling.


## Error Handling:
Implements try-except blocks to handle potential errors during data loading and processing.



## Requirements
Python 3.6+
Required libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn



## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Iris-Data-Analysis.git
cd Iris-Data-Analysis

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
Ensure the required libraries are installed.
Run the script:python iris_analysis.py


The script will:
Print data exploration results, statistics, and observations.
Generate and save a figure (iris_visualizations.png) with four visualizations.
Output insights derived from the visualizations.


## File Structure

└── README.md              # This file

## Assignment Details
This project fulfills the requirements of the "Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib" assignment. Key features include:

Dataset: Uses the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Data Exploration: Displays dataset structure, checks for missing values, and confirms data cleanliness.
Analysis: Computes statistics and groups data by species to identify patterns.
Visualizations: Creates four distinct plots with proper customization (titles, labels, legends).
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling for file loading and processing.
Insights: Provides observations from both analysis and visualizations, such as species-specific measurement differences and data distribution patterns.

## Output
Running the script generates:

Console output with dataset details, statistics, and observations.
A file named iris_visualizations.png containing four plots:
Line chart showing trends in mean measurements across species.
Bar chart comparing average sepal length by species.
Histogram showing the distribution of petal length.
Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between sepal length and petal length.


## Notes

The script can be converted to a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) by running it in Jupyter and saving the output.
The Iris dataset is a clean, well-known dataset, making it ideal for this assignment.
Visualizations use seaborn for enhanced aesthetics, as recommended.
